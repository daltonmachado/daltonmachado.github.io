## About me

11+ years of experience in software development. I love to solve problems and to ship projects. I always try to keep things simple in order to find the practical solutions with the right balance between cost, quality and maintainability.

## Projects
Here are some projects that I have worked on before.

### VR Escape Room Game | [Studio Abacate](http://studioabacate.com.br/)
VR game in which the player has to solve puzzles to escape from a dark morgue. Developed in Unity using SteamVR SDK, which makes the game run on every major VR headset. Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were the headsets used for development.

**What I did in this project**
- Overall Game Design and puzzle design;

- Project management;

- Gameplay programming (all object interactions and puzzle validations, generic system for turning objects like keys and handles and pouring/filling system for liquids);

- UI programming for some electronic objects with screens;

- Audio programming (SFX management and playback for a lot of continuous interactions, sharing AudioSources for multiple objects whenever possible);

- Scene setup (interactable objects placement);

- SteamVR setup (input, teleporting, scene loading, skeleton poses and pose interpolation for hands);

- Changes and extensions in SteamVR scripts to fit the project's needs.
