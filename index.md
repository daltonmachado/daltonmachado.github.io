## About me

11+ years of experience in software development. I love to solve problems and to ship projects. I always try to keep things simple in order to find the practical solutions with the right balance between cost, quality and maintainability.

### VR Escape Room Game | <a target="_blank" href="http://studioabacate.com.br/">Studio Abacate</a>
`Engine: Unity | Language(s): C# | Platform(s): PC VR`

VR game in which the player has to solve puzzles to escape from a dark morgue. Developed using SteamVR SDK, which makes the game run on every major VR headset. Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were the headsets used for development.

#### What I did in this project
- Overall Game Design and puzzle design;

- Project management;

- Gameplay programming (all object interactions and puzzle validations, generic system for turning objects like keys and handles and pouring/filling system for liquids);

- UI programming for some electronic objects with screens;

- Audio programming (SFX management and playback for a lot of continuous interactions, sharing AudioSources for multiple objects whenever possible);

- Scene setup (interactable objects placement);

- SteamVR setup (input, teleporting, scene loading, skeleton poses and pose interpolation for hands);

- Changes and extensions in SteamVR scripts to fit the project's needs.

### Wibx GO | <a target="_blank" href="http://studioabacate.com.br/">Studio Abacate</a>
`Engine: Unity | Language(s): C#, JavaScript/Node.js | Platform(s): Android, iOS`

Geolocation-based game with Augmented Reality features made using Mapbox SDK and ARKit/ARCore through Unity's AR Foundation package. Players can walk around the real world to catch frogs in traditional 3D or AR (like in Pok√©mon GO) and earn cryptocurrency in spots sponsored by brands that use the Wibx platform. Players can also customize their avatars, keep a record of captured frogs and engage in missions to win bonus cryptocurrency or real world goods. Developed for Wibx.

#### What I did in this project
- Game Design;

- Project management, planning and monitoring tasks and deadlines for all team members (myself, a junior developer, a 3D artist and an UI/UX designer) and interacting with Wibx's backend team to define core API features;

- Mentoring and code review for a junior developer who did part of the gameplay and UI programming;

- Gameplay programming (AR mode);

- UI programming (login, loading screen, missions, item pooling for dynamic lists);

- Game systems programming (Mapbox SDK integration and customization, frog spawn system, missions, AssetBundle loading, settings);

- Audio programming (music and SFX playback and management);

- Network programming (integration with game's backend API and Wibx platform API, user authentication, AssetBundle downloading and caching);

- AssetBundle build pipeline setup;

- Mapbox service setup (map styles, datasets and tilesets);

- <a target="_blank" href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/studioabacate/WibxGo-Full/1">Game's REST API</a> design, documentation and implementation (data management and access for frog types, spawn areas, missions, gameplay transactions validation, game settings) using Swagger, Postman, AWS Lambda (Node.js/JavaScript) and API Gateway;

- Game's backend services programming (Mapbox datasets and tilesets update automation);

- Database modeling and setup using AWS DynamoDB;

- Setup and management of other AWS services for the game's backend (IAM roles, S3, CloudFront, CloudWatch, Systems Manager Parameter Store);

- Backend migration between AWS accounts from Studio Abacate to Wibx;

- Demo releases through Unity Cloud Build;

- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/pull/1295">Bug fix</a> for AWS SDK.
