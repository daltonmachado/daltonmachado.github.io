## Memory Game | <a target="_blank" href="http://studioabacate.com.br/">Studio Abacate</a>
`Engine: Unity | Language(s): C# | Platform(s): Android, iOS`

Augmented Reality game made using Vuforia SDK. A memory game in which the player needs to match a word card with the relative image card for the word. The player can unlock 3 difficult levels and keep best score records. Developed for Pearson's Wizard English School.

### What I did in this project
- Overall Game Design, although pretty standard in this type of game;

- Gameplay programming (cards display, card selection, hit and miss conditions, win and lose conditions, particles playback, scoring);

- Game systems programming (asset and data management for cards using ScriptableObjects, difficult level unlocking and selection, best score persistence, pause, settings, scene loading);

- Audio setup and programming (mixer and audio effects setup and management, music and SFX playback with audio pronunciation for each card pair);

- UI setup and programming (title screen, difficult level selection screen, tutorial screen, HUD, game over screen, settings screen, exit screen);

- Design and implementation of all UI animations using tweening, with custom tools that I developed on top of LeanTween plugin;

- Card animations, also using tweening;

- Sprite animation setup (animation clip, AnimatorController) for the animated character in game over screen;

- Use of TexturePacker to manually pack sprites in order to improve quality and lower the use of storage and memory on mobile devices.
